# **Bank Customer Churn Prediction**

**Churn customer analysis**, means analyzing the data to understand customer behavior in which customers may or may not unsubscribe from your company product or service. Once you identify the customers that are at risk of churn, you can determine the next step, whether to offer that customer your newest product or service or offer them a discount or coupon. Acquiring new customer requires any company more asset than keeping an existing customer within the company, and due to that churn analysis and prediction is important. In this project, I used bank customer data to determine whether the customer has the risk of churn or not.
